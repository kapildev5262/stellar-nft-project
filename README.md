# StellarNFT Project

The **StellarNFT** project is a full-stack application that allows you to mint, transfer, and manage NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) on the **Stellar** blockchain using **Soroban Smart Contracts**. The project includes a frontend for interacting with the blockchain and a smart contract written in Rust using the Soroban framework.

## Features
- Mint NFTs on the Stellar blockchain.
- Transfer NFTs from one address to another.
- Retrieve the owner of an NFT by its token ID.
- Burn (delete) NFTs by their token IDs.
- Retrieve metadata associated with NFTs.

## Project Structure

This repository follows a structure that supports both the Soroban smart contract and the frontend application.

# Stellar NFT Contract Deployment Steps

## Requirements
- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  - You'll know you've installed nodejs right if you can run:
    - `node --version` and get an ouput like: `vx.x.x`
    - 
## clone git repository and install dependencies
```
git clone https://github.com/kapildev5262/stellar-nft-project
cd stellar-nft-project
npm install
```
## Steps to Deploy the Contract
### 1. Build and test smart contract 
```
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
cargo build
cargo test
```
This generates the Wasm file at: target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/stellar_nft.wasm.
### 2. Install the Contract Code on Stellar Testnet
Run the following command to upload the compiled Wasm file to the Testnet:
```
stellar contract install \
  --network testnet \
  --source alice \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/stellar_nft.was
```
- Replace alice with your Stellar account (configured in your environment).
- Note the output Wasm hash generated in this step.
### 3. Deploy the Contract
Use the Wasm hash from the previous step to deploy the contract:
```
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm-hash <WASM_HASH> \
  --source alice \
  --network testnet
```
Replace <WASM_HASH> with the actual hash provided during the installation.
### 4. Interact with the Contract
Once deployed, you can call contract functions using the Stellar CLI or integrate them into your application.

# Intracting with frontend

### 1. update your contract address and Pinata API key
Update your soroban nft smart contract address in frontend 
```
const contractAddress = "80c17635b126b9def6200f304e33a53fba907ac3610a5b777d0cb00d24a0e191"; // Replace with actual contract address
```
Update your Pinata API key in frontend 
```
Authorization: `39a660ce7ecbb7ae4114`, // Replace with your Pinata API key
```

### 2. install all dependencies and plugins
```
cd nft-frontend
npm install
```
This install all required dependencies and plugins for you frontend.
### 3. Open in browser and intract
```
npm run dev
```
This will run react app o localhost port now open it in browser.
Connect to freighter wallet.
Initialize the contract and start using it.
